# Join-me

## Introduction:
As part of a software engineering course, we conduct a development simulation, which includes most of the stages of the software life cycle, including experiencing teamwork and creating objects characteristic of each stage.



## Evaluation components and project content:
• An organized and orderly Git repository that includes the course products (documents), explanations and the code.

• Treatment of two types of users who receive services or work with the system in a different role/manner.

• Implementation of 2-3 central implementation processes that work from end to end (depending on the size of the group).

• Organization of central logic in an application server (Django/Flask, net.ASP, js.Node) that can be invented On a local computer or in the cloud - you can also use functions cloud Firebase or any infrastructure Serverless otherwise.

• Using any database (for example Firebase, MySQL, SQL MS, etc.).

• Regarding a display component (Android): implementation of at least 3 of the following: notifications, sensors, screen ,dialog, menu, broadcast, switching to another device component (camera/phone/messages, etc.)

• Regarding the display (Internet, Windows):) Use of templates from the MV* family

• The display must look professional and include human engineering as taught in the course (you can use the templates available online).

• The system must be designed (structural design) based on accepted templates (layers, microservices, clean code)

## JION ME:
### The project's description:

The project aims to solve a social problem in which people avoid various and occasional activities due to a lack of people. First and foremost, our app was created out of a desire to connect different people, while creating new friendships and fulfilling a variety of needs. Any person who desires in his heart to perform any activity, whether it is a multi-participant game, prayer, social entertainment, etc., can open a group or alternatively join an existing group depending on the place and time that suits him.
